### HomeKit Features

All Features in HomeKit are identical (in the name of the switch as well) to the capabilities of Tami4 Edge app. if you don't understand one of the features, use your Tami4 Edge device manual to read more about that capability.

### Issues & Debug

#### I can't control the device, it always goes to previous state

Check the internet connection and that you can control the device from Tami4 Edge app.
If that doesn't help, turn on debug logs in the plugin settings and look for errors.

#### Chromium Installation on hommebridge Ubuntu image

As Chromium requires snapd to run and the last is not working well in a dockerized environment, here is a workaround:
```
mkdir /homebridge/chrome
cd /homebridge/chrome
wget https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-snapshots/Linux_x64/1043527/chrome-linux.zip
apt update
apt install unzip -y
unzip chrome-linux.zip
ln -s /homebridge/chrome/chrome-linux/chrome /usr/bin/chromium-browser
```

#### others


If you experience any issues with the plugins please refer to the [Issues](https://github.com/nitaybz/homebridge-tami4/issues) tab and check if your issue is already described there, if it doesn't, please create a new issue with as much detailed information as you can give (logs are crucial).<br>

if you want to even speed up the process, you can add `"debug": true` to your config, which will give me more details on the logs and speed up fixing the issue.
